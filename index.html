          My name is Olli Mahlamäki. I'm a Finnish software developer working
          for <a href="https://wolt.com">Wolt</a> in Helsinki, a father of 2 and
          passionate sabre fencer and coach.

          I love building things that are used by lots of people and where I can
          see my impact. I tend to be very pragmatic about programming and
          prefer doing something that works now rather than building a beautiful
          architecture that will be done sometime in the future. I also try to
          be they guy who shouts "small batch sizes", cares about post-its on a
          wall and regular retrospectives - Agile may not be cool any more, but
          it's still incredibly useful.

          Wolt is a food delivery startup based in Helsinki. It is my second and
          this time hopefully successful try at startup life. Working in a fast
          growing startup is exiting and ever changing, in 1.5 years I've worked
          on merchant tooling, the public facing wolt.com web app and the
          courier app built with React Native. And did I mention we're hiring 😃

        </h3>
        <p>
          Hubchat was my first step into startup life. It was a discussion and
          commenting platform, leading with web and with matching iOS and
          Android apps. The company was lead by a very charismatic leader and
          managed to gather a good amount of investment and great talent, but
          the actual business ended up as nothing but hype with a very ugly end
          to the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the business was a failure, I learned a lot from my time there:
          it was my first time leading a team of developers and, from a
          technology point of view, a challenging server side rendered React app
          with shared apis between the web and mobile platforms. I also learned
          some healthy sceptisism and first hand experience about the negative
          sides of startups.

        <p>
          Reaktor is a premium software consultancy that combines skilled
          software development, design, data science and even satellites. I
          worked there as a software consultant in several projects, the biggest
          ones being at Elisa and Finnair.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time at Reaktor really pushed me forward as a developer. Functional
          reactive programming was really hot in Reaktor at the time and I got
          to work alongside the creator of
          <a href="https://baconjs.github.io/">Bacon.js</a> - this really pushed
          me to a new kind of thinking about code. Along with frp I also learned
          a lot about functional programming and, while I would no longer use
          bacon.js as the hammer to the nail that is the world, I still prefer
          immutable data and pure functions thanks to the lessons I learned
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also got to step away from web development and use my old Nokia
          skills in a project for Finnair, where we created new UIs for the
          infortainment screens on long distance flights. The techology used was
          QML, which is actually a great UI technology that just didn't get the
          development time and money it deserved because of the burning platform
          at Nokia.

        <p>
          Futurice is a premium software consultancy with a big focus on
          transparency and self-organization. I entered it as a student working
          part-time and left as a full blown software professional. I also got
          to see the growth of the company, I think I was employee number 27
          and, when I left, there were around 300 people working in multiple
          countries. They really focus on transparency and self organization, it
          is from my time there that I get the habit of asking "do we really
          need someone to approve this" or "why can't this information be public
          within the company".

        <p>
          Too many projects fit into 6 years to list here, but some of the
          highlights from that time include being the first employee sent to do
          a project in Berlin in what would end up being the German office ( I
          spent a total of 2 years in Germany ), building an e-book store for
          Elisa, working on what would have been the next version of Nokia Maps
          on top of Qt/QML (killed by burning platform) and many more.

        <p>
          At the time, Innofactor was a mixture of a product house and a
          consultancy. They had their own product Innofactor Prime and as
          developers we built custom versions of the product for different
          customers and projects. I got hired there as a second year student and
          worked part time during my studies and full time during breaks.

        <p>
          Other than the obvious thing of learning to be a professional
          programmer, the biggest lessons I still keep from my time there are
          around configurability: I saw first hand what it meant to have
          literally over a 100 different configurations of the same software,
          the challenges it caused but also the benefits of taking something we
          have, changing i18n strings and adding a few fields to create
          something completely different. It's also the reason I try to avoid
          making something configurable just because the team can't agree on
          what to do.

        <p>
          I studied in the department of engineering physics and mathematics,
          majoring in systems analysis with a minor in software production. I
          started working part time in my second year of studies and full time
          in 2007. In the end, I completed around 80% of the courses but never
          graduated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I don't work in the field I majored in, I still think that
          university level maths, physics and statistics are a solid base on top
          of which to build any sort of knowledge. And courses in algorithms and
          data structures or compilers have been very useful in professional
          life as well.
